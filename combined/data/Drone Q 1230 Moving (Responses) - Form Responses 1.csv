4/8/2017 17:26:52,Male,23,Little to none. Biggest experience with robots was using some lego technic about 10 years ago.,I've heard of them and seen one in use once or twice. Never tried them myself.,Fly in an almost straight line from one side of the room to the other.,That the robot prefers to take the shortest route possible. But it did seem to change the course slightly to not fly into me.,2,,"Fly from one side of the room to the other. It turned in mid-air and seemed to ""nod"" at me.",That it acknowledge I was in it's presence and could enter it's flight path.,9,,"Fly. It also looked at ""me"" and wiggled a little bit.","it acknowledge my presence. It even looked at me for a little before, almost like it waited for my attention.",9,,The drone quite clearly turned towards me and looked at me.,"I was acknowledge, but was otherwise unimportant.",6,
4/9/2017 20:33:45,Male,17,Drones,Flown one regularlly,Fly towards and slightly to the right of the cameraman,It is showing off the stable flight of the drone,3,,Same as previous video - Look at cameraman slightly longer than last,Showing off flying,4,,Same as previous -  Looked at camera and wiggled,More acknowledgment  ,5,,Fly - Less acknowledgement,Drone wasnt intested,3,
4/10/2017 23:03:21,Male,19,Very little,Heard about them,Look at the cameraman,It tries to avoid it,10,,Look at the cameraman,It is aware that it is there,10,,Look at the cameraman and wave around,It notices it and has problems flying,10,,Look at the cameraman,Knows it is there,10,

4/13/2017 17:14:59,Female,22,I do not really have experience with robots.,I know them but haven't used one,It flew rather steadily from the left to the right,That it is reliable,4,,Again it flew from the left to the right shortly looking at me.,It recognized me,8,,It flew from the left to the right and it felt closer now than the time beforehand,It was a bit too close for me,9,,"Flew from left to right, looking at me again",Nothing particular. It recognized me again,9,I saw the person filming in the glas :)

4/19/2017 17:26:35,Male,30,Novice exploration,"Own multiple, advanced hobbyist",Nod,Indicates awareness of my presence,10,Makes the drone appear polite,Raised its head,"Appears to say ""what's up?"" Although for some reason in a less pleasant way.",10,This gesture seems less polite and almost aggressive,Waved,This feels like a silly wave hello,8,Seems like less genuine of an acknowledgement than the previous gesture.,Looked at the viewer,Feels like a stare or maybe a special calibration,6,This gesture seems somewhat ominous and feels more like a calibration or a stare down than an acknowledgment.
4/19/2017 17:41:23,Male,48,none,average,Flyby with a slight knod - ,Scanning,2,I see what your trying to do.  The drone did a quick knod. That knod also started forward motion. It did not feel like a gesture.,Said hello,Defined my presence,7,AH! This gesture is not used for forward motion and it felt like a hello.,Dance or a wiggle.,Not as much as the quick nose up.,3,This motion took longer but didnt come off as communication.,Took a look,Defined that it saw me,8,YES! This was a look. It was expressive.  This should and can be used to acknowledge presence.
4/19/2017 18:34:23,Male,25,Not much,Owning and building several,Flew past me,It picked me up on camera or some sensor,10,,It nodded at me as it flew past,It saw me in the peripheral,10,,It waved at me,It saw me,10,,"It rotated to look at me, then went on its way",It had no interest in me.,7,
4/19/2017 20:40:06,Male,27,none,I have been building and flying drones for 3 years,The drone flew from one side of the room to the other.,"To me, it looks like it's on its way to somewhere",0,,"The drone flew from one side of the room to the other, stopping in the middle to ""nod"" at the cameraman.",The drone noticed that I was there and let me know.,10,,"The drone slowly flew from one side of the room to the other and ""waved"" at the cameraman by rolling back and forth.",The drone knew I was in the room and let me know.,10,It seemed to be moving slightly slower this time,"The drone flew from one side of the room to the other, only turning slighty this time instead of ""nodding"" or ""waving""","The drone still knew I was in the room and let me know, but didn't stop to acknowledge me.  Maybe in a hurry/busy already?",8,
4/19/2017 20:55:45,Male,17,Only quads ,Build and race quads ,"It flew past us. At a slow pace. Slight top close as of today but if it's intelligent, that proximity might be ok. It also pitches forwards to then pitch pack. ",That whoever is piloting it had a slight panic attack. I could see it signaling a nod or similar ,6,,Pitched back and than went its own  way ,It saying hi/watsup/or acknowledge You ,9,,Wobble on the roll axis ,"I can't really see it meaning much, perhaps ""get out of the way"" ",4,,Turned to look at us and then turn away ,It sees us,8,
4/19/2017 21:14:27,Male,18,none,"owning one, built one",flew across the room,maybe it was programmed (because of the chip ontop of it),0,,twitch backwards,slowing down,10,because it looked towards me i think it knew where I/camera was and tried to avoid or at the least show me it saw me ,wiggle,being playful or saying hello,10,,look towards the camera,it saw me ,10,
4/20/2017 8:35:17,Male,28,Fly quadcopters,Own several. I have two brushed Mico quads as pictured above,Flew close and past me after viewing me,The pilot saw me but did not maintain a safe margin.,7,,The pilot pitched backwards to acknowledge my presence,The pilot has situational awareness of my person.,10,,The drone pitched left then right while looking at me.,It could be an acknowledgment of my person or a gyro flight correction due to wind ,5,,The drone turned to face the camera before proceeding past.,That I am acknowledged but the person did not maintain other situational awareness during the flight ,7,
4/20/2017 15:37:57,Male,25,Drones,Own one,Fly across the room,It was going somewhere,1,,"Fly across the room and ""nod""",It was aware of me,7,,"It flew across and the room and shook its head ""no""",It doesn't want to be bothered,5,,It looked at me,It was noting my presence,3,

4/20/2017 21:36:13,Other,27,Very little non RC robot experience,Scratchbuild / repair quads as hobby,It did a 'nod',"""I see you there""",7,"Looked unsteady, like it wasn't accounting for momentum during the nod.",It did a 'nod' in the opposite direction as Video 1,""" 'sup? """,7,Looked safer and more stable than video 1 - also acknowledged from farther away.,It did a 'wiggle',"""Notice me sempai""",7,"Less obvious acknowledgement to non-hobbyists than Video 2, less stable of an indicator too.",It just looked at me,"""I see you there""",7,Not really any better/worse than Video 2 - but much less impact on flight path and stability.
4/21/2017 0:03:09,Male,21,None,I own one.,It nodded at me.,"It was greeting me, Like a stranger saying hello on the street.",9,,It nodded up to me.,"I don't know, I have Aspergers, I'm quite bad at social queues.
