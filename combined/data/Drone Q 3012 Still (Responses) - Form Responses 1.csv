I would take a step back in such scenario,6,,It looks like it nodded up,"It wanted to back off, or look up.",6,
4/11/2017 23:13:04,Male,20,Seen many in person ,"Build them, fly them, film aerial shots with them",Did a slow fly by,It's going somewhere ,3,,Pointed at the camera ,It possibly mapped the position of the camera (if its autonomous),5,,Flew closer than it should have,It's stupid ,5,,Same thing as in the 2nd video ,It noticed a figure there,7,

4/19/2017 19:51:15,Male,30,none,bought one and built another,turned to face me and dipped its arms in a brief gesture,"it acknowledged me, possibly a greeting?",9,,rotated to point in my general direction,"not sure, possibly part of its obstacle recognition process?",1,,Turned to face me and dipped its front briefly,It acknowledged me and performed a greeting,8,"The front dip seems to imply more respect than the roll ""wave"" which is more cheerful and implies it is a peer",Turned to face me and raised its front briefly,it possibly acknowledged me and performed a gesture that might be a greeting,5,In my culture this gesture would be used between friends and would seem weird for a stranger to do this
4/19/2017 21:09:50,Male,28,"FIRST robotics, MiniQuads",Own a LOT of drones.,hovered/ flew towards the camera with a little ossilation,it was controlled by a person,1,,"flew towards user, yaw'd right a bit",noticed an object near the drone camera ,7,,"flew towards user, nodded when it noticed an object",it registered that a person was in the way and automated a response. ,9,,"saw a person, nodded",human like..,8,
4/19/2017 21:33:33,Male,15,Robot Vacuum,"I own multiple, 2 racing and 1 aerial photography",Shake from left to right,It seems that it noticed I was there.,7,Didn't feel completely natural but was pretty good,Turned on the yaw axis towards me.,That it noticed something(me) is there,3,"Less realistic, would be more realistic if the camera, or eye, pointed towards me.",Pitched towards me.,That it noticed that I was there,7,Feels the same as the first video in how it acknowledged me however I think this was a more serious 'greeting' compared to the first more playful 'greeting',It pitched forward and back.,It knew that something was there.,6,Slightly less realistic than the last in my opinion.
4/19/2017 21:33:51,Male,42,very little,own 3 toy grade and 1 slightly bigger,Turned to face me and wiggled,Seemed like it was acknowledging me watching.,10,,Turned to face me and then turned away,"It saw that something was there, turned to get a closer look and then continued.  So, I felt like it saw me, but didn't care to let me know.",2,The previous video where it wiggled seemed like it was trying to let me know it saw me.  This time it didn't feel like it was communicating anything to me.,Turned to face and then dipped before continuing.  Felt almost like a head nod.,"While this did feel like a head nod that you'd use to acknowledge someone on the street, it didn't feel as meaningful as the wiggle for communicating that.  Maybe the wiggle felt more like a wave.",7,,faced me and uptilted.,Kind of like walking on the street.  Downward nod of your head tends to be acknowledging someone there that you don't really know and lifting your chin is more used for people you're friends with.  This felt like it conveyed more meaning than just a bare minimum.,8,Maybe I'm reading too much into these.  Wiggle is still my preference for a friendly acknowledgement.
4/20/2017 3:14:44,Male,33,None,Own one,"Hover, then fly slowly past",On set path to destination. ,0,,Same move with a yaw adjustment to face the camera then back to original path,Drone was aware of presence but made no adjustment to it path,7,,"Same as first video with yaw adjustment to face camera, accelerated towards camera then second yaw adjustment to continue on original path. ",Seems like it was moving to avoid a perceived object or that it over corrected for speed. ,5,,"Flew along same path as original clip, yaw turn to camera and short pitch back for deceleration, then yaw to continue on original path. ",Drone reacted to camera by slowing when it detected the camera. ,9,
4/20/2017 3:41:23,Male,25,Build and fly fpv racing drones (3+),Built one somewhat similar to it.,Drifted forward.  Turned to face me.  Wiggled.  Kept moving.,It may have viewed me.,8,,It drifted forward.  Panned past me.  Panned towards its original direction.  Then continued moving.,The drone likely scanned the area behind me.,4,,The drone drifted forward.  Yawed toward me.  Pitched down towards me.  Then returned towards its original direction.,The forward movement toward me was only the result of its pitching forward. Its movement toward me was the direct result of the pitching.,6,,"It drifted forward. Yawed toward me.  Pitched up.  Turned towards its original direction, then kept moving forward.",The drone gesture was meant as a test to figure out what drone gestures mean.,7,
4/20/2017 16:07:50,Male,23,automated fro-yo machine,I own one.,"fly toward me, rotate, then continue flying.","it was doing its thing, then took a second to look at me, then go on its way.",10,,same as the first drone,same as the first drone,10,,"flew, then looked at me high and low",it was looking at me,10,,same as the last video,same as the last video,10,

4/24/2017 13:07:34,Male,23,Bachelors degree in Automation and Computer Control (Thesis was done using an industrial robot),Own one (FPV Racer),The drone turned towards me and twitched on it's roll axis a few times while continuing on it's course.,For me it signals that the drone is greeting me.,10,"For me this gesture is unmistakable, I also like the sound the motors make during the roll, makes it easier to acknowledge.","The drone turned towards me on the yaw axis, kept looking at me for a few seconds, then turned back towards it's heading, never changing course.",I would interpret that the drone is about to change course towards me and I should evade.,0,"As far as i'm concerned the drone has no idea i'm here and it's about to turn into me, the 'looking at me' part might be coincidence.","The drone turns towards me on it's yaw axis, then it does a short pitch forward to  my direction.","This means I should step back, as a drone has just turned into me.",2,"I guess it could work if you know what to expect, but this sort of behavior would make me nervous to be around. i.e. it's understandable as a gesture, but any pitching like that towards a person could be hazardous.","The drone turned towards me and then pitched back quickly, before continuing on it's course.",I would interpret that as a drone seeing me and trying to avoid me.,10,"It's unmistakable that the drone spotted me, I still like the roll gesture more though. Pitching back feels like i'm too close and it's trying to avoid me."
4/28/2017 11:48:48,Male,24,Little to no experience,Know about them although not in detail,It recognised something with a sensor as it was flying,Some kind of greeting maybe. In the beginning I thought it was because the drone was unstable.,5,,"It turned to the side while flying, keeping the same direction/flight path",I don't know,0,,Fly and then did some kind of a nod,"It seemed faulty, like it was malfunctioning because the nodding happened too fast.",3,,Nod upwards,It seemed more of a greeting this time as the drone did not seem as unstable/having malfunctioning behaviour.,7,
