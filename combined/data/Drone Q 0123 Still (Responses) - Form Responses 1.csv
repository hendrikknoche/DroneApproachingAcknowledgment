4/9/2017 18:12:42,Female,23,"I saw a human-like one at the Dublin tech conference, but that's it!",Heard about them in the news and seen vloggers using them for YouTube videos. ,"Nothing much, it just flew towards me really loudly and then moved on. ","It seems very invasive being so noisy and coming up so close, but I couldn't clearly see what its purpose was or why it was in an empty room like that. It was kind of disconcerting.  ",6,It reminded me of an insect.,"It wasn't very different to the last one. Once again it flew from the left, towards me. ",Maybe it could be surveying something.  ,8,It was slower and also lower down which made it seem less threatening. ,"It came by, seemed to acknowledge my presence with a nodding kind of movement and then it moved on. ","It seemed more normal, maybe even friendly than the other ones. ",9,,"Once again it flew in from the left, did a little shake when it saw me and then moved on. ",Definitely looked like it was taking note of me being there.,10,"I hope in the future that they get quieter, that noise is by far the most intimidating aspect! hah "

It's flying but then it does a little nod to acknowledge an object/person.,It sensed the presence of an individual. ,7,It still looks a bit like malfunctioning flight,It wiggled a bit.,"It was saying 'hi' i guess, but the rotors are too intimidating and something i do not see as relatable to emotion, so it's hard to focus on this gesture. it still looks like it's coming to kill us",7,

It indicate some kind of videotask.,6,The drone turned a little too early to be looking directly at me. But I had an understanding of a reaction from the drone for something maybe me.,Fly from the left towards the right. This time with a earlier respons towards me and almost a kind of a nod.  ,That the drone were reacting on me and maybe made a gesture to acknowledge my presence.,8,A very different experience from the frist video. More accurately and quickened ,Allmost the same as the second video. But the recognition was a bit earlier. ,The same as the second video. ,9,The early acknowledged is more trustworthy as it is a robot and not a human being who may respond slowly.,Fly from the left towards the right and made a different tilting gesture on its way.,Still some kind of observation of my presence. ,6,"The ""nod"" (up and down) movement works best for a greeting. But this could be some other kind of nonverbel message.  "

It was facing about 30 degrees away from me and then turned towards me for a brief moment and then continued on its path,It noticed some object in the middle of the room and reacted to it.,7,,Similar as before but it was turned more towards the center (me) for the initial movement. Then it made a turn towards me and pitched forward for a moment almost simulating a nod,Simulation of a nod like a person would do to indicate 'hello' as they walked by,8,,Almost identical to the second except it nodded up rather than down,The drone pitched backward. This type of 'nod' is more of the bro nod saying 'what's up' more than the previous which is more of a polite hello,8,,Similar flight path as all the others.
